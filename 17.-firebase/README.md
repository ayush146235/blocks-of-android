# 17. Firebase

Firebase is a cloud-based framework and NoSQL database for mobile applications which, through the API, allows development companies to store and synchronize data between clients.

In 2016, Google announced the new and significantly improved Firebase product , FCM is a tool for the exchange of free messages using cloud technologies. FCM is fast, reliable, and most importantly â€“ supports cost-free delivery of your messages, which is great for startups and established businesses, alike. Of course, sending messages using cloud technologies is not a novelty.

Google has a service they created years ago and their users still use, today - Google Cloud Messaging. Google developers, however, have concluded that FCM is a more convenient service - the major reason being that you do not need to know or see the server code to send messages through FCM.
