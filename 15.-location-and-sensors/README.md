# 15. Location and Sensors

Some of the mobile applications are more popular compared to their corresponding websites for many reasons. These reasons range from portability, full time connectivity \(you can’t be on your computer all the time but your phone can be with you all the time\), etc. Along with these one more important factor is that mobile phones can provide functionality that can’t be provided by the websites. For example, we can find a person’s location using GPS, speed using accelerometer, barometer to find out atmospheric conditions etc. These fancy instruments come with even lesser expensive phones as well. It’s very important for developers to take advantage of these to enhance the user experience.

Let’s look at some popular examples of sensors and other hardware components. We will also look at how we can use them in our applications.
